# Rebecca Dagenais

I never knew how I could turn my creativity into something that I could make a living on. When I discovered the world of graphic design I fell inlove with the beauty of it and how the simplist things could make the world of difference and make you smile. Design is now my love in my life and I can't wait to continue to grow as a designer.

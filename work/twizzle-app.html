goal: This project was a re-design for the Ottawa Network for Educationâ€™s website. I designed the website following wireframes created by a ux designer and an approved visual style. I created all pages in HD-Desktop size and mobile followed by roll out for development.
obstacles: It was hard to figure out how to connect the app to a physical experience. Another obstacle was to figure out what data to show and how to find the data after it is recorded for future use.

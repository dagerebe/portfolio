supersub: Application to help improve a figure skaters performance
goal: The goal of this app is too help figure skaters improve their skills and figure out what they need to improve on or where they are going wrong in their performance. 
obstacles: It was hard to figure out how to connect the app to a physical experience. Another obstacle was to figure out what data to show and how to find the data after it is recorded for future use.
outcome: The app uses fictional movement technology from a skaters, skates and then translates the data. The user is then able to name the recording and edit the name and make any notes on the performance. Then the app shows data for a map of your recorded performance, speed and stability. Once the user is finished with the recording they can always access the list of recordings from the data button at the bottom of the screen.

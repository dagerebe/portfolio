supersub: Movie and TV show streaming site
goal: The goal of my Saas website was to make someone want to buy the services after viewing the site
obstacles: Some obstacles I came across was how to create a unique selling poing that I could advertise on the site. I also needed to look at trends to help me determine the best way to present the call to action.
outcome: In the end I came up with a movie and TV streaming site that allows the customer to watch movies that are still in theatres with the largest plan. I created a night out to the movies theme to present the site differnt than other streaming sites already out there.

supersub: A webpage to promote a new unique web store.
goal: The gial of this project was to create a logo and a launch page for a new site coming soon.  
obstacles: I needed to figure out a way to engage people on the site right and way and hopefully it would lead to them donating to us to start up.
outcome: I kept the site quite simple to allow people to easily understand what is going on with minimal works and the use of icons. I also wanted to keep the experience short beacue people are busy and don't have alot of time in their day to spend on a site let alone donate money.

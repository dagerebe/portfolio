supersub: Personal quotebook about life
goal: The goal of this peice was to create a personal piece full of quotes that represented me and also showed off my typographic talents.
obstacles: An obstacle I had to encounter was trying to figure out who I was and how to portray myself.
outcome: I created a book of quotes about life because I love my life. I carved all of the quates out of rubber and made stamps. I used different textures of papers becasue I find joy in different textures and feels. Then I bound it myself to give it the final hand done feel.

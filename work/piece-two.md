supersub: A more eco friendly package design
goal: In the re-packaging of Unico Penne pasta my goal was to create a more eco friendly and visually interesting package. I was also trying to accomplish making it useful.
obstacles: Some of the obstacles I encountered were what materials I should use for the package and what shape to try and make it more eco friendly and visually appealing. I was also struggling with how to make it useful.
outcome: I accomplished my goals by using a unique shap for the box making it also easier to pour. I used seed paper that grows herbs for the cap. This cap also is a single serving measure.
